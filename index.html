<h3 id="org7091260">What is the virtual OW platform?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7091260">
<p>
The virtual OW platform is a set of integrated tools, documents and instructions allowing a certified OW trainer to deliver an OW entirely on-line:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ensuring participants live an immersive "seeing the system" experience close to the one designed by Barry Oshry</li>
<li>keeping all essential ingredients as close as possible to the original "in-person" OW</li>
</ul>

<p>
The benefits of the virtual OW platform are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>flexible and extensible design based on 2 modules (same day or not!) for the core "4 or 5 CCI days" OW: compatible with the attention patterns of participants in the virtual world</li>
<li>a safe process to (re-)allocate roles, for participants and in the support team, when anybody could disappear, willingly or unwillingly, into the Internet no/poor connection "black hole" without any warning</li>
<li>a mechanism to distribute role-specific support materials in the virtual space</li>
<li>a resilient system for money exchange for all transactions (Customers and Tops), for all real-time information needs (like Middles/Bottoms salaries) and for the production of deliverables by Bottoms teams</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 id="org933a802">How do participants experience the virtual OW?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org933a802">
<p>
Participants in a virtual OW use 2 distinct software simultaneously:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a meeting platform for:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>receiving instructions and OW strategic frameworks in webinar mode</li>
<li>participating to group interactions: TOOTs, debriefs, Q/A&#x2026;  in meeting mode</li>
<li>communicating with other participants in separate virtual rooms via audio, video and room chat</li>
<li>moving between virtual rooms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the work documents platform for:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>CCI customers creating contracts and payments within their pre-assigned budget</li>
<li>CCI TOPS consulting customer payments and using available funds to pay salaries and bonuses</li>
<li>CCI BOTTOMS creating and presenting the deliverables for CCI customers on one shared PowerPoint document per team</li>
<li>CCI MIDDLES and BOTTOMS checking their remuneration</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
To understand better how to use the virtual OW as an OW trainer, you should first discover the real screens participants will use by following the <a href="https://vowinfo.authentica.eu/participant">walk through on our website</a>.

<h3 id="meeting-platform">What meeting platform for the virtual OW?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-meeting-platform">
<p>
Zoom is the recommended meeting platform as the virtual OW requires these features:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Breakout rooms which enable small group meetings with video</li>
<li>A large room where the host can “call back” all participants and where +/- 30 participants can see each other video</li>
<li><b>Movement capability</b>: some participants can see who is in which breakout room, and can move freely (without the assistance of the meeting host) between any of the breakout rooms</li>
<li>Possibility to grant/suppress this <b>movement capability</b> to any participant (via the "co-host" status in Zoom)</li>
<li>Easy editing by participants of their screen name (to make their OW role visible to all other participants)</li>
</ul>

</p>

</div>

<p>
Why do we not recommend Microsoft Teams?
As of early 2021:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the base paradigm of Teams are conversations (not meetings like Zoom or Webex) and one must visit all conversations to which a user is registered to know in which conversation (s)he is currently present with video.</li>
<li>it is unclear how to grant/suppress <b>movement capability</b> to  participants.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Webex seems to be a viable alternative. As we have no experience with it, we do not provide any guidelines for its usage.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Computer with speakers/microphone/camera on the Internet: PC with Windows 10 or Mac with OS 10.9 or later. <br />
No Android/IOS tablet or mobile phone!</li>

<li>Access to Zoom either:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>via an Internet browser: one of the 2 last versions of Google Chrome (PC or Mac) or Microsoft Edge (PC). This browser will also provide access the the virtual OW document platform.</li>
<li>or via the installation of (or update to) the last version of <a href="https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting">Zoom Client for Meetings</a>. And then also access to the virtual OW document platform via one of the 2 last versions of either Google Chrome / Safari / Firefox / Microsoft Edge</li>

<div class="warning" id="org512e5b3">
<p>
When delivering a virtual OW within a company, company-wide IT policies/configurations could block participant PCs to access the virtual OW!
</p>

<p>
To anticipate this risk, conduct these tests/conversations BEFORE committing to the virtual OW delivery
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Instruct to access Zoom <b>via an Internet browser</b> (without any downloaded program)</li>
<li>Ask your client contact to check that "Zoom via Internet browser" is OK and that they are no firewall restrictions to <b>access without login</b> to Google Docs and shared Powerpoints. You contact must be able to access these 2 links : 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Read access to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LiF7eEOHSCNJX4n97Zy5Z2fcURXet9bFdDcYyHujtAE/edit?usp=sharing">worksheet</a></li>

<h3 id="tech-support">What are the requirements for the support team?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-tech-support">
<p>
The support team has the same requirements as participants, with Zoom installed on their computer. Support team members must also have a Google account, either:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>an account in their corporate Google Workspace</li>
<li>a personal Google account: /something/@gmail.com</li>
</ul>

<p>
If their corporate account has restrictions and/or they do not want to use their Google account to manage virtual OWs, members of the support team can create another Google account just to manage virtual OWs: goto <a href="https://account.google.com/">account.google.com</a> 
</p>

<p>
Members of the support team need also a "back channel" between them to communicate without disturbing the participants: any chat based application, like WhatsApp, can be used. <br />
Additional requirements are needed to ensure the <a href="#support-continuity">support roles continuity</a>.

<h4 id="orgf6405f1">2 core modules</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf6405f1">
<p>
To maximize participant engagement, we have designed the virtual OW in 2 core and 2 optional modules of 75 minutes to 3 hours each, which could be delivered together or over multiple days/weeks:
</p>


<div id="org83d718d" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/four-modules.png" alt="four-modules.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The “core OW” consists of Modules 2 and 3. Modules 1 and 4 are optional:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The first module "See The System" (+/- 75 minutes) is optional. It is a mini-OW to use when technology presents some important challenges for participants. It is also used when it is desirable for participants to have the experience of two different positions in the organization.</li>
<li>The second module "Understand Partnership Derailers" (180 minutes) covers the OW Transition-in, Days 1 &amp; 2, and the first TOOT.</li>
<li>The third module "Create Partnership" (150 to 180 minutes) covers Days 3, 4 &amp; 5, the second TOOT, and the Transition-out.</li>
<li>The fourth module "Implement Transformation" guides participants in applying the insight of system forces towards implementing personal and/or organizational transformation (action plans).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Modules 2 and 3 together cover the first experiential exercise cycle of 5 days including all the strategic frameworks covered during the first day of the workshop in the Leader’s Guide.
</p>

<p>
An example of a potential Module 4 is included in the <a href="#reference-docs">reference documents</a> with 2 sections built on the OW framework, one for a more organizationally oriented application and the second one for a more personally oriented application.  
</p>

<p>
Scheduling these modules on different days allows to give participants homework: journaling, preparation, application&#x2026;

<h4 id="org8fa0f73">Design differences with in-person OW</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8fa0f73">
<p>
The key other design differences between the official OW Leader’s Guide from powerandsystems.com and the virtual OW modules are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Bottom shoes" are replaced with the freedom to move between virtual rooms. At the start of the 5 days, Bottoms are moved into their respective team work room and they cannot move. But customers, Tops and Middles can move freely between virtual rooms. From the second day onwards, Tops can decide to use some of CCI money to pay the Government to buy movement freedom for one (or more) Bottom(s).</li>
<li>The “Side Show / Centre Ring” image is replaced by “Sidetracked / Centered”</li>
<li>The strategic frameworks are delivered in a slightly different order to allow to give participants homework between modeles 2 and 3 to check the fit of their reality with "Sidetracked" and "How Come It Goes The Way It Usually Goes"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Module 2 delivers the following strategic frameworks after TOOT #1:   
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sidetracked (Side Show) [but not yet Centered (Center Ring)]</li>
<li>How Come It Goes The Way It Usually Goes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Module 3 starts off from these strategic frameworks and asks participants to apply them beginning on day 3 of the experiential exercise:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Centered (Center Ring)</li>
<li>What Else Is Possible</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-number-paxs" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="number-paxs">What are the min./max. number of participants?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-number-paxs">
<p>
The virtual OW can distribute roles to minimum 10 and maximum 38 participants.
</p>

<p>
You can have 9 or 8 participants by assigning 1 or 2 customer roles to a member of the support team (or to their colleague(s)/business partner(s)) instead of 1 or 2 participant(s). We have run 2 virtual OW workshops with respectively 11 and 9 participants: in the virtual world the Top/Middle/Bottom/Customer contexts conditions worked very well with this small number of participants. 
</p>

<p>
You can have more than 38 participants by distributing the same role to 2 participants who work then together: ideally in a Bottom team. We do not recommend to go too much above 35 participants to avoid <a href="#support-continuity">risks of degrading their experience</a>. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-demo-premium" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="demo-premium">What are DEMO and PREMIUM workshops?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-demo-premium">
<p>
When you register for the virtual OW platform, you get access to your first workshop: the DEMO workshop with a name starting with "DEMO". In a DEMO workshop, all financial transactions executed by the OW customers (contracts and payments) or CCI TOPS (salaries, bonuses and BOTTOM promotions) are automatically reset to zero every hour. The DEMO workshop is fully functional for all other dimensions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>creating/distributing role links and sharing the participants/roles list</li>
<li>adapting role descriptions, allocating roles and sharing the role descriptions</li>
<li>providing a global timer and real time sharing of pictures across all virtual rooms</li>
<li>allowing up to 4 groups of participants to use a shared Google Slides file where they can create presentation together</li>
</ul>

<p>
So you can use your DEMO workshop for all your explorations / tests / rehearsals and to deliver workshops of your own design to as many participant groups as you want with as many consecutive sessions as you desire.
When you need to deliver a virtual OW to "real clients" you can buy a PREMIUM workshop with a name which does not start with "DEMO":
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>its financial data will not be reset to zero</li>
<li>it will run only during 2 windows of 5 hours: one for module 2 and one for module 3</li>
<li>its name includes the dates you have chosen to run module 2 and 3</li>
<li>it uses PowerPoint - instead of Google Slides - to create shared presentations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you order a <a href="#demo-premium">PREMIUM workshop</a>, you must specify the start date/time of the two 5-hours windows where the PREMIUM workshop financial transactions will be operational: one for module 2 and one for module 3. Outside of these two 5-hours windows, the financial transactions will not work! To avoid any time zone confusion, <b>you must give these start date/time in the UTC time zone (Coordinated Universal Time)</b>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if you need to understand what UTC is, go <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html">here</a></li>
<li>to go from your local time zone to UTC, you can use this <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html?p1=1440">meeting planner</a> . Be careful with the date: it could be different in your time zone and the UTC time zone!</li>
<li>please triple check: you are the only responsible if you make a mistake in the UTC date/time you give us for your 5-hours windows</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you have your two UTC 5-hours windows (and the name of your <a href="#vow-workspace">vOW workspace</a>), you can order the creation of a PREMIUM workshop <a href="https://vowinfo.authentica.eu/pricing-access#h.ngp433sjkd08">here</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-support-roles">
<p>
While experienced facilitators will readily deliver an in-person Organization Workshop alone (with minimal help from a client assistant), the virtual (on-line) version adds a layer of risk and complexity that is mostly outside the control of the facilitator - namely its reliance on information &amp; communication technology.  At the same time the virtual environment severely limits all non-verbal communication cues - for instance: participants disappearing or disengaging, or conversely trying to catch the facilitator’s attention by raising their hand.
These specific roles must be fulfilled in the support team: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Host</b> (or Technical Coordinator): The Host role corresponds to the Zoom Meeting host. The Host prepares the virtual breakout rooms, ‘accepts’ participants into the Zoom Meeting, grants participants  co-host status (to enable movement between breakout groups), calls back all participants into the main meeting room at the end of the breakout sessions (OW days), etc.. The Host also helps all participants with any technical problems. The virtual OW Host should therefore remain as much as possible in a room accessible by all participants from inside and outside the meeting platform (the Main Room in Zoom).</li>
<li><b>Facilitator</b> (or Trainer): The virtual OW Facilitator delivers all the virtual OW materials (including instructions on how to use the meeting platform), gives all OW instructions to the participants (except customer training as indicated hereafter), manages time to ensure completion within the planned schedule, manages the TOOTs, monitors the chat during plenaries. In addition, this role helps the TOPS to understand and master their financial transactions during day 1.  The Facilitator will therefore join the TOPS in their virtual breakout room as soon as the Transition-in is finished.</li>
<li><b>Support-Roles</b>: This role allocates the OW roles to the participants ahead of the Transition-in and provides access to each participant to their work documents.</li>
<li><b>Support-Customers</b>: During the second part of Transition-in and at the start of first OW day this role explains to Customers their role (Customer Orientation) and the use of their Customer work documents for projects/payments.</li>
<li><b>Support-Tops</b>: At the start of first OW day this role explains to Tops the use of their Tops work documents for tracking cash and remunerations.</li>
<li><b>Support-Government</b>: During all OW days, except the first one, this role answers any OW-related questions that participants may have, and checks that the payment for the promotion of Bottoms has been made before instructing the Host to promote them to co-host.</li>
</ul>

<li>Section names match section names in the Powerpoint presentations available in <a href="#reference-docs">reference documents</a>. The task "Presentation - this section" presents section "Welcome" from the Module 2 presentation.</li>
<li>CLOCK1 and CLOCK2: clock times in 2 different time zones. You can enter the start time on line 3.</li>
<li>LEN.: the elapsed time in the current section</li>
<li>DUR.: the planned duration, in minutes, of the task on the same line (line 40: participants changing their Zoom name is planned for 4 minutes). All tasks without a duration, considered as duration = 0 for the purpose of time calculations, are concurrent with the first preceding task that has a duration and are deemed to finish before that preceding task. (line 35: this task should be completed before the task on line 33 is finished)</li>
<li>Role: the role in the support team executing this task: see <a href="#support-roles">role descriptions</a>. PAXS means participants.</li>

We recommend that you use initially a support team of 3 people to deliver the virtual OW. And once you have built some experience and you understand how to mitigate risks, you can move progressively to a support team of 3 people during the first hour and 2 people during the rest of the workshop:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Host must remain available and easily reachable throughout the entire workshop to both welcome participants at the start of the workshop and, more importantly, to be ready to help with technical problems or with participants (re)joining on-going meetings in the right breakout room (e.g. in case they dropped out or accidentally left a meeting). The Host should therefore not take any other significant role. It is the only ‘full-time’ role even though this role may not always be active. <b>A first support team member</b> must be dedicated to the Host role.</li>
<li>The Facilitator role is active throughout the entire workshop - except for the OW days. <b>A second support team member</b> must be dedicated to the Facilitator role.</li>
<li>The Support-Roles is only active during the first half-hour of Module 2 (and Module 3 if not sequential) and could be done by an experienced Host.</li>
<li>The Support-Customers role is active in parallel with the Facilitator and the Host roles during the second half-hour of Module 2 (and Module 3 if not sequential). So we need here <b>a third support team member</b>.</li>
<li>The Support-Tops role is active only during the first OW day and could therefore be taken by the Facilitator.</li>
<li>The Support-Government role is active only during the OW days 2 through 5 and could therefore be taken by the Facilitator.</li>

Notes: <br />
(1) Number of hours per person for this activity <br />
(2) Total number of hours fort his activity <br />
</p>

<p>
So the total time needed is 45 hours for a team of 3 people, with 11 hours for the Zoom producer and 34 hours to share between the 2 facilitators (with a minimum of 9 hours for the non-lead facilitator). 
</p>

<p>
To reduce this time investment, you can buy support as indicated in the <a href="https://vowinfo.authentica.eu/support">support page</a> on the main website.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-support-continuity">
<p>
The biggest impact on participants' experience of the virtual OW is likely to occur in the event that one or more support and/or participants’ roles suddenly and unexpectedly ‘disappear’ (for more than a few minutes) in the course of the workshop - due to a serious technical problem with either computers or Internet connections, or due to participant drop-out. 
</p>

<p>
Here are the different roles from greatest to least potential impact: (1) Host, Facilitator, and Support-Roles, (2) Support-Customers and any participant in Customer role, (3) Support-Government, (4) any participant in MIDDLE role and (5) any participant in TOPS or BOTTOM role.
</p>

<p>
We recommend thus the following risk mitigation measures: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b>For the support team</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Plan for a minimum of 3 people in a support team with limited experience, with the 3rd person taking not only the Support-Customers role and possible the Support-Roles role, but also on stand-by to jump into the Host or Facilitator role if one of these drops out of the virtual meeting.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All members of the support team should (MUST if only 2 people in the support team) have at their disposal 2 computers (main &amp; backup) and 2 independent means of accessing the Internet (e.g. a cable Internet access via Wi-Fi or preferably wired LAN, and a backup access like 4G via a smart-phone). They must all avoid ANY operating system updates during any virtual OW sessions (for Windows 10: go to Windows Settings - Update &amp; Security - Advanced Options - Pause updates)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>For the participant drop-outs after role allocation</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is difficult to detect when certain roles have dropped out. So It is IMPERATIVE to explain well in advance to participants - and ultimately to their management or training administrator or project leader &#x2026; - that they must commit to attending all sessions in their entirety. And that too many drop-outs could result in an entire module being cancelled, even after it has started.</li>
<li>Specific recommendations for role allocation in case of drop-outs are detailed in the <a href="#role-allocation">role allocation process</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>For the participant technical set-up</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For participants within the same company, checking well in advance if IT policies/configurations would <a href="#tech-participants">interfere with the virtual OW access</a></li>
<li>All participants should receive instructions at least 2 weeks before the virtual OW sessions to configure their computer and test this configuration for access to the meeting and work document platforms.</li>
</ul></li>

In case of (very) late newcomers, S-Rol can:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>first use the remaining open roles in the role list</li>
<li>when they are no more roles available, just pair the newcomer with an existing role, preferably Bottom</li>
</ol>
<p>
And then in both cases:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>change the newcomer Zoom name</li>
<li>if needed, ask the Host to  give the newcomer co-host status</li>
<li>distribute the corresponding role link to the newcomer</li>

<p>
In case of late drop outs,  S-Rol should consult the Presenter before making any change. Here are some guidelines to avoid too complex role changes for participants:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If one or two Customers drop out, a support team member should take over the role during the OW days.</li>
<li>If a MIDDLE drops out, S-Rol should promotes a BOTTOM to MIDDLE role and ask the Host gives her/him co-host status.</li>
<li>If BOTTOMS drop out to the point where a BOTTOMS team has only one member, S-Rol reallocates that BOTTOM to another team. (No Bottoms Teams should only have one member).</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ms-office-google">
<p>
As of end 2020, we experience the following situation in Google Workspace:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Native Google Docs/Sheets/Slides are very attractive in a multi user situation: real-time editing/commenting and "infinite" undo/redo</li>
<li>The compatibility between Google and Microsoft formats, for our type of work, is:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Very good for Google Docs to/from Microsoft Word</li>
<li>Very good for formulas/text based Google Sheets to/from Excel. Zero for macros/programming and advanced database functions.</li>
<li>Poor for Google Slides to/from PowerPoint: font and formatting issues.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
So we have adopted the following guidelines for our virtual OW work:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For text and spreadsheet documents, do all work related to the virtual OW within your vOW workspace in Google Docs/Sheets format. Download as Microsoft Word/Excel only to share "non-live documents" outside, like an email attachment with instructions to participants.</li>
<li>For presentation documents:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If OK for the/all editor(s), use only Google Slides. Then to avoid formatting issues, present always in Google Slides.</li>
<li>If PowerPoint must be used by only one editor, this editor could keep the master version on his/her PC and, if needed, upload to Google Drive for sharing with read/commenting-only co-workers</li>
<li>If PowerPoint must be used with multiple editors, all editors should <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7329379">download and use Drive File Stream</a> to see who's editing with real-time presence in Microsoft Office. And they must all pay attention to avoid simultaneous edits.</li>
</ul></li>
